# Car-Price-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression
# overview
The project aims to develop a predictive model for estimating the selling price of cars using a dataset provided by CarDekho.The dataset includes various features such as the car's name, year, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and number of previous owners. The key steps in the project include data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## Project Structure
The project repository contains the following files and directories:

1. `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and the structure of the repository.
2. `car_dekho_dataset.csv`: Dataset containing information about cars sold by CarDekho.
3. `Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## Usage
1. Explore the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
2. Run the code cells in the Jupyter Notebook to perform data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
3. Analyze the model's performance metrics and diagnostic plots to assess its effectiveness in predicting car selling prices.
4. Experiment with different preprocessing techniques and model configurations to improve the model's accuracy and interpretability.

## Outcome
The success of the project is evaluated based on the performance metrics of the trained model, including R-squared and Adjusted R-squared. Additionally, diagnostic plots such as residual plots, Q-Q plots, and fitted vs. actual plots are analyzed to validate the model assumptions and identify areas for improvement.
